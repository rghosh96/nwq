### welcome to the nwq guide

This is a very basic guide to working at the Northwest Quad at the University of Arkansas. This page is in no way affiliated with the University of Arkansas or University Housing. It is an independent project to get some practice with responsive web development from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

There are a variety of resources a Quad staff member can find on this page, such as:

* Building specific information
* General NWQ info
  * Dining hall hours
  * Mail
  * Etc
* Duty procedure
  * Regular duty
  * Weekend duty
  * Break duty
* Desk operations


More functionality to come! Such as duty calendar, desk schedule, and program dates :)
